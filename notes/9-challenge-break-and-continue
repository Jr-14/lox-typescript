# Break and continue statements

## Break statement

A break statement moves the control flow from the current scope, to the parent scope if it exists.

For example:
```
var i = 0;
if (i < 1) {
    var j = 1;
    print "hello";
    break;
    print "world";
    print j;
}
```

This prints to standard output `hello` and skips the next print statements. 

Once the break statement is reached, it restores the parente environment as the current environment.
